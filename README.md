</p>

---

Rocket Pool is a next generation Ethereum Proof-of-Stake (PoS) infrastructure service designed to be highly decentralised, distributed, and compatible with Ethereum's new consensus protocol.

Running a Rocket Pool smart node allows you to stake on Ethereum with only 16 ETH and 1.6 ETH worth of Rocket Pool's RPL token.
You can earn a higher return than you would outside the network by capturing an additional 15% commission on staked ETH as well as RPL rewards.

This repository contains the source code for:

* The Rocket Pool Smartnode client (CLI), which is used to manage a smart node either locally or remotely (over SSH)
* The Rocket Pool Smartnode service, which provides an API for client communication and performs background node tasks

The Smartnode service is designed to be run as part of a Docker stack and generally does not need to be installed manually.
See the [Rocket Pool dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/rocketpool) page for a complete list of Docker images.


## Installation

See the [Smartnode Installer](https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode-install) repository for supported platforms and installation instructions.

## Development

A [Makefile](./Makefile) is included for building, testing, and linting.

* `make all` will build rocketpool-cli, rocketpool-daemon, and run the linter.
* `make rocketpool-daemon` will build the docker containers required to build the daemon, then build the daemon.
* `make rocketpool-cli` will build the cli for linux and osx.
* `make test` runs all unit tests.
* `make clean` deletes any binaries. It does not clear your go caches.

## CLI Commands

The following commands are available via the Smartnode client:
