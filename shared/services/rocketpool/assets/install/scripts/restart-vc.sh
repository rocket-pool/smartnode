#!/bin/bash

# This script is used to restart your Validator Client service.
# It is run in Native Mode only when the Smartnode needs to restart your Validator Client (for example, to load new minipool keys).
# It is not used in standard (docker-based) Rocket Pool setups.

# The command below is an example only.
# Replace it with your own commands to restart your Validator Client service.

#sudo systemctl restart lighthouse-validator
